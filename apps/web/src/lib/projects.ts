    challenge: "The client inherited a large, leaking pond that had been neglected for over 15 years. The original clay lining had deteriorated, water levels were critically low, and the surrounding stonework had collapsed. Invasive plants had taken over, smothering native species.",
    solution: "We carried out a full de-silting operation, removing over 3 tonnes of accumulated sediment. The existing liner was replaced with a premium butyl rubber system, and we installed a new concrete collar around the entire perimeter. A comprehensive native planting scheme was designed to attract local wildlife while maintaining clear sight lines from the main house.",

    challenge: "The homeowners wanted a natural swimming pond in their clifftop garden, but the exposed coastal location presented unique challenges including salt-laden winds, shallow bedrock, and extreme weather conditions.",
    solution: "We designed a sheltered, wind-resistant pond with a robust concrete shell foundation laid directly onto the bedrock. A specially selected salt-tolerant planting scheme was used in the biological filtration zone, and local Cornish slate was sourced for the surrounding deck and retaining walls.",

    solution: "We designed a deep, L-shaped pond that followed the contours of the garden terracing, maximising volume within the available footprint. A hidden plant room houses the multi-stage filtration system including mechanical, biological, and UV stages. A viewing window was set into the lower terrace wall.",

    solution: "We diagnosed the leak to a failed seam in the original liner, which had degraded over 20 years. We drained and temporarily rehomed the fish, removed the old liner, and installed a new welded EPDM system with a protective underlay. The filtration was upgraded and all planting refreshed.",
